## Figuring out the Stuff

### Day 15 - 11/07/2019

Reading the websites regarding Startups - in Berlin (one of the so-called hubs). There are others, in Hungary, Poland and Portugal. Netherlands is also a good one, and also Finland and Switzerland. According to the ECR document (zotero library)

This one is Amsterdam...

A thought I had. What everyone is trying to is to take 'out' the human in the process. Everything is automatized in such a way - with a program software - to take away responsibilties. The computer can scale indefinitely and this is the business model in anything.
So... when does it become profitable (or when is the impertus there) to scale indefinitely in terms of hiring Human (or otherwise sentient individual lifeforms)?




Top 40 startups to follow (?)
