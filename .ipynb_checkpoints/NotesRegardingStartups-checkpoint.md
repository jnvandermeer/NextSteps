### Day 15 - 08/07/2019

Reading the websites regarding Startups - in Berlin (one of the so-called hubs). There are others, in Hungary, Poland and Portugal. Netherlands is also a good one, and also Finland and Switzerland. According to the ECR document (zotero library)

Then, most promising (according to them) startups:
- Coya - Insurance - made - easy - and - cheap (never get insured by car-hire or airplane, you pay the hauptPreis & have bad conditions... and nagivating the mess is too much hassle - they do it, is I think the idea)

Then, so-called Venture Capital Firms

Less Risk & more Proven = more 'trust' - and more money). They have Turkish connection and are quite big/experienced
- Point Nine - Early Stage
- Project A - Otto Mail order Company - advertising, e-commerce and SaaS.. software licensing !?
- Rocket Internet - apps and etuff; food, fashion, groceries, etc
- *Holzbrinck Ventures - early stage; education, mealthcare, fintech (.. this is a thing !?).. See FlixBus (that's a startup !?)*


Then, the "Players":
- Chrostophe Maire - Foodtech
- Christian Vollamnn - early guy, political connection, "single-digit percentage range" .. whatever that means
- Michael Brehm - made companies now in posession of Google and eBay.. hmm...
- Michael Kalkowski - Gaming Connection
- Thomas Hessler, Blockchain, portfolio over 200 startups

Accelerators and incobators

- Axel Springer Plug and Play Accelarator
- Beyond 1435 - match with corporations, mentorship
- Hub\:raum\: ...they recruit also with AI.. might be interesting.. given the right purpose

So conclusion... lots and lots of stuff is happening. The only way to nagivate it is to go & see it!

And see what kind of stuff is there.
